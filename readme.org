#+title: Grid Generator

A toolkit for generating paper-sized grid SVG templates for tools like Goodnotes 6.

* Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run ~npm install~
3. Run ~npm run dev~ to start the web view
4. Visit [[http://localhost:9000]] to view the web server

* Pipeline

Once the grid designs are to your liking, use the cli to generate SVGs.

#+begin_src shell
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "letter-portrait"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "letter-landscape"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "spread"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "year"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "projects"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "calendar"
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "calendar" 2024 1
npx nbb -m grid.cli.render "calendar" 2024 all
#+end_src

The first argument should refer to the last segment of a grid.docs.* classpath,
files are located in the =src/main/grid/docs= directory.

Those commands will output SVGs to the ~out~ directory in the project folder.

From there you can import into Inkscape and export to PDF. This retains the
vector nature of the SVG supporting zooming in and out and the template
rendering crisply.
