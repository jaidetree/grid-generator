#+title: Grid Generator

A toolkit for generating paper-sized grid SVG templates for tools like Goodnotes 6.

* Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run ~npm install~
3. Run ~npm run dev~ to start the web view
4. Visit [[http://localhost:9000]] to view the web server

* Pipeline

Once the grid designs are to your liking, use the cli to generate SVGs.

#+begin_src shell
npx nbb -m grid.tasks.render "letter-portrait"
npx nbb -m grid.tasks.render "letter-landscape"
npx nbb -m grid.tasks.render "spread"
#+end_src

Those commands will output SVGs to the ~out~ directory in the project folder.

From there you can import into Inkscape and export to PDF. This retains the vector nature of the SVG supporting zooming in and out and the template rendering crisply.
